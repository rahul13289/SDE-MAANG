This repository consists of System Design questions that FA on MAANG companies. 

SD's:

As we know that, Low level design and high level design are the two important catgories of SD.

1)OOP

2)S.O.L.I.D

3)DESIGN PATTERN 

4)CASE STUDIES 

Let us deep dive into the concept of S.O.L.I.D principle necessity:

(1) 𝗦 - 𝗦𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗹𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗲: Think of it as the 'one job' rule. Every module or class should have one reason to change, ensuring simplicity and clarity in design.

(2) 𝗢 - 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗻/𝗖𝗹𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗲: This principle advocates for software entities (like classes, modules, functions) to be open for extension but closed for modification. It encourages us to extend a class's behavior without altering its source code, fostering long-term robustness.

(3) 𝗟 - 𝗟𝗶𝘀𝗸𝗼𝘃 𝗦𝘂𝗯𝘀𝘁𝗶𝘁𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗲: Named after Barbara Liskov, this principle ensures that objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application. It’s all about ensuring that subclasses maintain the behavior expected by the base class.

(4) 𝗜 - 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗮𝗰𝗲 𝗦𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗴𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗲: Don't force a client to implement interfaces it doesn't use. By keeping interfaces small and specific, we avoid the pitfalls of 'fat' interfaces which can lead to cumbersome and tangled code.

(5) 𝗗 - 𝗗𝗲𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 𝗜𝗻𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗽𝗹𝗲: This principle advises us to depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It means designing our systems so that high-level modules aren't dependent on low-level modules, but both depend on abstractions.
